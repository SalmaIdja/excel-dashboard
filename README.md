🌍 Overview
This repository contains an interactive Global Energy & CO₂ Dashboard designed to explore long‑term trends in energy consumption, emissions, and renewable energy adoption across countries and years.

The dashboard provides a clean, modern interface for analyzing:

Total energy consumption

CO₂ emissions

Renewable energy share

Energy mix (fossil vs renewables)

Per‑capita metrics

Geographic CO₂ distribution

Growth of solar, wind, and hydro

The goal is to make global energy insights accessible, visual, and dynamic.
