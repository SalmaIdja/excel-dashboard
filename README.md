🌍  World Energy Consumption

Tool: excel
Data Source: Owid-CO2-data.csv &word energy consumption.csv dataset
Objective: The goal is to make global energy insights accessible, visual, and dynamic.

  
Project Overview 
This repository contains an interactive Global Energy & CO₂ Dashboard designed to explore long‑term trends in energy consumption, emissions, and renewable energy adoption across countries and years.
The dashboard provides a clean, modern interface for analyzing:
Total energy consumption
CO₂ emissions
Renewable energy share
Energy mix (fossil vs renewables)
Per‑capita metrics
Geographic CO₂ distribution
Growth of solar, wind, and hydro

 Tools & Technologies
