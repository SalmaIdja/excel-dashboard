#  World Energy Consumption

#### Tool: excel
#### Data Source: Owid-CO2-data.csv &word energy consumption.csv dataset
#### Objective: The goal is to make global energy insights accessible, visual, and dynamic.

  
# Project Overview 
This repository contains an interactive Global Energy & CO₂ Dashboard designed to explore long‑term trends in energy consumption, emissions, and renewable energy adoption across countries and years.
The dashboard provides a clean, modern interface for analyzing:
Total energy consumption
CO₂ emissions
Renewable energy share
Energy mix (fossil vs renewables)
Per‑capita metrics
Geographic CO₂ distribution
Growth of solar, wind, and hydro

 # Tools & Technologies
This project was built entirely using Microsoft Excel, leveraging advanced features:
## ✔ Power Query
•	Automated data import
•	Cleaning and transformation
•	Merging multiple datasets
•	Normalizing country names and time series
## ✔ Data Modeling
•	Fact & dimension tables
•	Relationships between tables
•	Star schema for efficient analysis

# Dashboard Features
